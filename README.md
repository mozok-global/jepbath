JEP Bath

JEP Bath is a luxury bidet store that needed a better website to showcase their products. After a consultation, the client described their frustration with the Wordpress and WooCommerce platforms. Shopify was suggested and agreed upon as the platform to migrate the old website to.

The migration was straightforward and easy to configure on the Shopify platform. Minimal data cleanup was required. The client currently only ships in United States, so the backend configuration was seamless.

The frontend configuration was more complex. Building on the Dawn 2.0 theme, various customizations were needed to make the UX (user experience) more pleasing. The default zoom level on the images was off-putting and was scaled down.

Image optimization and compression were done to reduce the load-speed on the homepage. A custom coded button was also added to the featured product on the homepage.

The color scheme of blues and light greys were chosen to induce a calm feeling while maintaining a clean and crisp design. Custom copywriting for the collections, warranty, about, and return and refund policies were also implemented.

The client has retained my services for paid social media advertisements as well as offline localized direct marketing.
